# Shopping List Program
This is a simple and intuitive shopping list program written in Python. It helps manage and organize your shopping list in a more systematic and efficient way. The program is structured in a way that makes adding, removing, and managing items easy.
# Project Structure
The project is divided into three main folders - core, conf, and a folder that contains utils, shopping_list_class, models, and helper.

- `core`:
This is where the main logic of the program resides. It contains an app.py file.

- `conf`:
This folder contains configurations and logging settings for the project.

- `shop`(The third folder contains):

  `utils`:
  Utilities and helper functions used throughout the project.

  `shopping_list_class`: This is the heart of the program, where all shopping list 
  functionalities are handled.

  `models`: Contains data models used in the project.

  `helper`: Additional helper functions to support the main program.

In addition to these folders, there are three main files:

- `run.py`: This is the entry point of the program. To run the program, you would 		need to execute this file.

- `shop_items.csv`: This contains the list of items that can be added to the 				shopping list.

- `gitignore`: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
